Shaders
* Shader `Custom/Fur(20 Layer)`
  * 20 pass cut-off fur shader
  * not support shadow
  * not support multi-lighting
* Shader `Custom/Fur(DX11)`
  * 1 pass cut-off fur shader
  * need geometry shader supported
  * support shadow
  * support multi-lighting
  * only support forward-path

Note
* This classical fur effect uses lots of draw calls per light per object. And Unity is not support multi-pass shadow caster, so the first shader cannot draw shadow correctly.
* I tried to write a geometry shader version to instead of multi-pass. The dx11 version only need 1 draw call per light per object, and shadow caster pass works well.
* I tried the custom BRDF too, but it has problems in linear color space need fixed.
* It's also can be implemented as a deferred version for performance on multi-lighting, to reduce the calculating in geometry shader.
